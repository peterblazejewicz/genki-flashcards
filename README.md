Where are these files?
----------------------
Flash cards are available as separate files within "flashcards" folder. In future these files will be also available as one single file with multiple categories comments added within text:

```
// Genki One/Greetings
おはよう		Good morning
...
はじめまして		How do you do?
よろしく　おねがいします		Nice to meet you
// Genki One/Lesson One
あの		Uhm
...
```

so Pleco Chinese Dictionary will read these categories during cards import.
